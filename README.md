# Elevators Pitch With Power Words

Good Afternoon, my name is Donovan and I have recently graduated with a Bachelors degree in Computer Science. I come from a musical and technical family who would to take me to musical events and computer fairs as a child. In music i achieved grade 8 in piano, and i believe that my musical background has helped me develop the analytical mind that i have now.

In university i studied computer science as a whole therefore i established a wide range of computing skills including database concepts, web scripting, software development and more. For my final year project i created a bespoke invoicing system for small businesses using html, PHP, and phpMyAdmin. This amplified  my interest in programming and I felt a real sense of achievement when I reached basic functionality.

I first heard of DevOps when i attended one of the assessment days at sparta global where initially I applied for software development. I bumped into one of my uni friends who was on the devops course and he made it seem very appealing to me. This clarified that DevOps would be the best department to use and develop the skills that I picked up whilst at university.
